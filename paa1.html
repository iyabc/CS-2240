            the the youngest of the two children of Julius Mathison Turing and
            Ethel Sara Turing. His family belonged to the upper-middle-class,
            with his father working for the Indian Civil Service

          <p>
            Alan's mother went to India to reunite with his father when he was
            about a year old, leaving Alan under the supervision of family
            friends. He went to St. Michael's in 1918, Hazel Hurst Preparatory
            School in 1922, and Sherborne School in 1926. He showed a great
            interest in chess and eventually joined the debating society.

              United Kingdom. He graduated with first class honors in 1934, and

              A day after the declaration of the WWII in 1939, Turing arrived at
              the Bletchley Park after being requested to join the Government
              Codes and Ciphers School where he took up a full-time role in
              deciphering German military codes. This lead to the development of
              the Bombe in 1940.

              With the help of the Bombe, Turing and his team were able to
              decrypt German secret messages encrypted by the Enigma in 1942.
              Polish mathematicians lead by Marian Rejewski were the first to
              read Enigma messages before the Germans increased its security,
              which lead to them turning over the messages to the British.

              for his achievements and contributions in which he helped in the
              decyphering of German codes that helped change the course of the
              war.

              In 1946, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory where he
              published a paper with the first the first detailed design of a
              stored-program computer. He also published a report called
              'Intelligent machinery' that discusses about the possiblity of
              machines to possess the intelligence of a human. In 1950, he
              published'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he
              develops the Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a
              machine to be called intelligent.

          In 1952, Turing started a relationship with a 19-year-old man named
          Alan Murray. Murray then burgled Turing's house, then reported the
          incident to the police. This caused Turing's acknowledgement of his
          homosexual relationship with Murray, which lead to his prosecution for
          his homosexual acts. He opted for chemical castration by a series of
          injections of female hormones as an alternative to being imprisoned.

            On <span style="color: #df5c53">June 7, 1954</span>, 16 days before
            his 42nd birthday, Turing died in his home in Wilmslow, Chesire,
            England. He had died a day earlier and was found the next by his
            housekeeper. The cause of death was determined to be suicide by
            cyanide poisoning. A half-eaten apple laced was cyanide was found
            next to his body. There are many speculations as to why Turing did
            it, many of which are associated with the mental effects of the
            medication inflicted on to him by the court and the discriminations
            thrown unto him due to his sexuality. In 2013, Turing received a
            posthumous royal pardon granted by Queen Elizabeth II, almost 60
            years after his conviction. He is considered the
